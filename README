We have developed a model for MultiPath-TCP (MPTCP) in ns-3, which conform to RFC 6824 and closely follows the MPTCP Linux kernel desgin. 

A brief description of our model can be found in our recent short paper, which was presented at the WNS3-2014 workshop, with the following link: http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07721

You can refer to this code in your paper by citing the above short paper.
Evaluation of congestion control of MPTCP
Testing notifications

run ./setup.sh to automate ./waf clean ./waf configure and ./waf

Create multiple topologies to test congestion. Under tutorial/examples ns-3 provides examples of differing topologies that we can extend.
Create multiple TCP connections between hosts in order to test congestion control.
Use FlowMonitor and built in tracers to evaluate.
Later, once evaluations are done, we can look into tweaking existing algorithm
